This repo includes the following:
1) Implementation of different heuristic search algorithms such as A* and Weighted A*.
2) Implementation of different Multi Agent Search algorithms such as Minimax, AlphaBeta and Expectimax.
3) Implementation of Policy-Iteration and Value-Iteration algorithms for Markov Decision Processes - MDPs.
4) Implementation of ID3 algorithm for Decision Trees.
5) Implementation of Direct and Inverse Kenematics Algorithms for a 6 joint robotic arm in ROS environment.

** In each repo you will find the necessary instructions for each task in the pdf file of that repo.
